    <p>I am Enebong hope but my mother calls me “Ahopy”. I turned 12 years old
        this August and I study in class 7th. I have an elder sister named Aishwarya. She is like a second mother to me.
        I have a group of friends at school and out of them Manvi is my best friend. She visits my house at weekends and
        we play outdoor games together. I believe in her and I can share anything with her.

       <p>Science and technology fascinate me so I took part in an interschool science competition in which my team of 4
        girls worked on a 3-D model of the earth representing past, present, and future. It took us a week to finish off
        the project and we presented the model at Ghaziabad school. We were competing against 30 teams and we won the
        competition.</p> 

       <p> I was confident and determined about the fact that we could win because my passion helped me give my 100% input
        in the task. Though I have skills in certain subjects I don’t have to excel in everything, I struggle to perform
        well in mathematics. And to enhance my problem-solving skills I used to study maths 2 hours a day.</p>

       <p>I wanted to become a scientist, and being punctual and attentive are my characteristics as I never arrive late
        for school. Generally, I do my work on my own so that I inculcate the value of being an independent person. I
        always help other people when they are in difficult situations. </p>
